# Project Starter

You can use this for your starter Web Project.

this starter project has parcer and MVC Architecture
most of it the unused JS is just an empy JS file & the rest of it is for you to working on your own project.

Dont forgot to "npm i" to install the JS Library

here's my recommended VSCode extention :

1. Template LIteral Editor
2. Prettier
3. html tag wrapper (find the best one)
4. font awesome auto complete & Preview
5. ESLint (idk about this one but good to go)
6. Color Highlight (good for color preview right from the code)

also dont forgot to delete the section tag in HTML cuz they're just a filler

The rest is up to you so good luck with your project...

Happy Coding :D

NOTE: Please put your own favicon in "./src/img/favicon.png" if there's isn't any img folder then create it yourself
